I"™<p>The Company is specialized in Small Tankers chartering, product or chemical tankers, bitumen tankers or bunkering tankers. We handle all types of liquid bulk cargoes; petroleum products, chemicals, vegoils and liquid foodstuff on very polyvalent or specialised vessels.
We monitor the charter market, vessels positions, cargoes flow and identify the right tankers for the right trade. Our approach is global and not only per geographical areas. We identify, select the best vessels or charters requirements, guide and conclude fixture negotiation, and we follow vessels operations until the charter is ended and all possible pending issues have been solved.</p>
